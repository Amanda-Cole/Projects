# EmployeeManagement
Employee Management Program in C#
# Overview

Build an employee management program that allows the performs multiple functions, and reads and writes to a txt file.

This software shows a basic employee management program that allows for the addition and deletion of an employee.  This program also 
reads and writes to a txt file.

I wrote this program to practice the concepts of object oriented programming, and to become more fluent with the C# language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Used current version of Visual Studio to build program.

I used C# as my programming language.  I used the standard library and the System, System.IO, and System.Collections.Generic namespaces.

# Future Work

Things I need to continue to improve on:

- Planning: I need to spend more time planning out the classes and variables, and also write pseudocode.
- Time Management: I need to focus on smaller parts of the code and not get to deep to quick.
- Manage Sources: I need to stick to quality sources and not spend time searching for other sources or getting stuck with AI.
